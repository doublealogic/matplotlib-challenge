# Pymaceuticals Project (matplotlib-challenge)

### In this project, I take everything I've learned about matplotlib thus far and used it towards this repository.

## Background

### This takes place at a fictional company, Pymaceuticals, Inc. As a senior data analyst at the company, I've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. I have been tasked by the executive team to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. The executive team also has asked for a top-level summary of the study results.
